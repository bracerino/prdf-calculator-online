**PRDF Calculator Online**

An online tool for computing the Pair Radial Distribution Function (PRDF) and Global RDF for crystal structures.

ðŸ”— Try it here: [PRDF Calculator](https://rdf-calculator.streamlit.app/)

##How It Works:
1) Upload your crystal structure (structures) file (e.g., CIF or POSCAR format). If you upload more than one file, averaging of PRDF for the corresponding combinations of elements between the structures will be performed. 
2) The tool will compute the PRDF and Global RDF.
3) View the plotted graphs and download the corresponding data.
