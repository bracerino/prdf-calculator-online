**PRDF and XRD Pattern Online Calculator**

An online tool for computing the Partial Radial Distribution Function (PRDF), Global RDF, and XRD pattern for crystal structures.

**How It Works**
1) Upload your crystal structure (structures) file (e.g., CIF or POSCAR format). If you upload more than one file, averaging of PRDF for the corresponding combinations of elements between the structures will be performed. 
2) The tool will compute either the PRDF and Global RDF, or XRD pattern.
3) View the plotted graphs and download the corresponding data.
